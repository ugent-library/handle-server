herein, CNRI hereby grants to Licensee: 

     a. A nonexclusive worldwide royalty free permission to install, 
reproduce, modify, display and/or perform publicly and distribute HDL 
Software to the public, with or without modification, in source or 
binary form; and 
	
     b. A nonexclusive worldwide royalty free license under the 
Patents, only to the extent necessary to permit (i) Licensee's exercise 
of any of the rights granted in Section 2.a; and/or (ii) Licensee's 
implementation or operation of an identifier and/or resolution service 
using the Handle System Technology. 

3.  Conditions of License: Any exercise of the rights granted herein 
is subject to the following requirements:
 
     a. Each module of HDL Software, and any software or other work 
that is created by Licensee and is based on or includes all or any part 
of HDL Software, whether retained by Licensee, or made available to 
others, shall include CNRI's copyright notice and the following 
resolvable link <http://hdl.handle.net/4263537/5030> to this HSPL 
(Ver.2). Licensee shall also require all of its own licensees of any 
such module, software, or other work to include the same copyright 
notice and link in all works of such further licensees that are based 
on or include all or any part of HDL Software. 

     b. Licensee may not exercise any of the rights granted herein for

Interface Specification; (ii) uses prefixes (or their functional 
equivalent) that are not authorized by CNRI or that are not known to 
the Global Handle Registry(R) ("GHR"), the top level of the Handle 
System; or (iii) resolves identifiers for which the GHR has no 
effective means of responding to resolution requests relating to 
Licensee's identifier and/or resolution services. CNRI may grant or
withhold the approval and consent referred to in the preceding 
sentence in its sole discretion. 
	
     c. In the event that Licensee alone, or in cooperation with any 
other party, wishes to provide identifier and/or resolution services 
that use or are based on the Handle System Technology, whether or not 
Licensee uses HDL Software, then as a material condition of this HSPL 
(Ver.2), Licensee must register with CNRI and enter into and maintain
