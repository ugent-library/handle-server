UPGRADING FROM AN EARLIER VERSION

In version 7, we have provided a script 'hdl-server', located in the 'bin'
directory of the distribution, which should be run to start the handle server.
The script takes a single argument, the handle server directory.

(The command used in version 6 to start the handle server will not work,
as multiple Java jar files are now required to run the server.)

There are no changes required in the configuration of your handle server.


INSTALL.txt

How to Install the HANDLE.NET (version 7.3) software:

NOTE: The HANDLE.NET server should not be installed inside a firewall
unless the handle ports (default ports are tcp:2641, tcp:8000, and
udp:2641) are opened for all incoming and outgoing messages.

PLEASE FOLLOW THESE STEPS IN ORDER.
1) Install Java version 5 or greater on your computer.  Note: if Java is
   already on your computer, type 'java -version' at the command prompt to
   find out what version has been installed.

2) Unpack the handle system distribution into a directory on your
   computer.  For the rest of these instructions, we will assume this
   directory is /hs/hsj-7.3/.

3) Choose a directory that will hold the configuration and data for
   this server.  For the rest of these instructions we will use the
   /hs/svr_1 directory. Be sure to create a new directory for each
   server on the same machine. To create this directory on unix, run
   this command:
     mkdir -p /hs/svr_1

4) To set up and configure a new or existing server, run the following
   command.
      On Unix-like systems:
        /hs/hsj-7.3/bin/hdl-setup-server /hs/svr_1

      On Windows systems:
        \hs\hsj-7.3\bin\hdl-setup-server.bat \hs\svr_1

   Both installation programs will prompt you for your server's IP address
   and the port(s) the server will listen to. By default, the HANDLE.NET
   software will bind to the following ports:
     TCP: 2641 and 8000
     UDP: 2641

   There should not be any other servers listening to these ports.

   Be sure to remember the passphrase you used for both the server
   Certification and Administration. You will need the server
   Certification passphrase to start your server and you will need the
   Administration passphrase to load your private key which is
   necessary for authentication when creating and modifying
   identifiers in your service.

5) Once the configuration file has been generated, you will need to
   upload the generated sitebndl.zip file to the CNRI Handle System
   Administrator (hdladmin@cnri.reston.va.us). First go to
   (<http://hdl.handle.net/4263537/5014>) to register to become a
   resolution service provider and then upload your file.  Also please
   read and agree to the Handle System Service Agreement
   (<http://hdl.handle.net/4263537/5029>) and pay the associated fees
   for your prefix.  Note: if you have already registered go to
   (<http://hdl.handle.net/4263537/5032>) to upload your configuration
   file.

   The Administrator will then create the prefix on the root service
   (known as the Global Handle Registry(GHR)), and notify you when
   this has been completed.  You will not be able to continue the
   install until you receive further information concerning your
   prefix.

   ONCE YOU RECEIVE YOUR PREFIX INFORMATION FROM HDLADMIN THEN
   PROCEED WITH THE FOLLOWING STEPS TO 'HOME' YOUR PREFIX TO YOUR
   NEW SERVICE.

6) Go to your svr_1 directory(where you installed the software) and
   edit the config.dct file. Replace the words "YOUR_NAMING_AUTHORITY"
   under "server_admins" and "replication_admins" with your naming
   authority/prefix (as indicated in your email message from
   hdladmin). This allows anyone with the private key that matches
   your public key to be an Administrator for your identifier and/or
   resolution services.

7) Start your HANDLE.NET server using the configuration generated in step 4.
   This can be done with the following command:

      On Unix-like systems:
        /hs/hsj-7.3/bin/hdl-server /hs/svr_1

      On Windows systems:
        \hs\hsj-7.3\bin\hdl-server.bat \hs\svr_1

   Note: If you chose to encrypt your private key(s), you will be
   prompted for your passphrase here. Also note that Java does not
   have the ability to disconnect from a terminal so you will have to
   put the process in the background. On Unix systems press Ctrl-Z
   then bg then press Enter.

   For testing purposes you can use a web browser to connect to your
   server by opening the URL http://<your-IP-address>:8000/ where
   "your-IP-address" is the address that was entered in the setup
   process.

8) Start the Handle Tool using the following command.

      On Unix-like systems:
        /hs/hsj-7.3/bin/hdl-admintool

      On Windows systems:
        \hs\hsj-7.3\bin\hdl-admintool.bat

   Please see Chapter 3.2 of the Technical Manual
   (<http://hdl.handle.net/4263537/5031>) on how to run the tool.

9) Choose the menu option Tools -> Home/Unhome Prefix.

   In the Prefix box enter 0.NA/Your_prefix.

   Under "By Site Info File (siteinfo.bin)" click "Choose File..." and
   select the siteinfo.bin file in your handle server directory:
   /hs/svr_1/siteinfo.bin

   Once your server is contacted, you will be prompted for authentication.

   Next to 'Your ID' put 0.NA/Your_prefix in the first box,
   and 300 in the second.

   The 'Key Type' should be 'Public/Private Key'.

   Click 'Select Key File' to browse to your private key file.
   It will be in the /hs/svr_1 directory (where you installed your
   server) and is named admpriv.bin.

   You will be prompted for your passphrase.  This is the password you
   entered for Administration when you ran hdl-setup-server.

   This may take a minute to process.

   You should receive a successful message, and now you are ready to
   create handles in your local HANDLE.NET instance.  To create
   handles, enter the new handle in the Handle Tool and click the
   "Create..." button.  Your authentication information can be your
   public/private key pair that was used for homing your prefix.
   Remember each handle requires an administrator.

   You can now Add, Edit, and Remove values from the new handle;
   click "Create Handle" when this is complete.

   For complete documentation on HANDLE.NET version 7.3 please refer
   to the Technical Manual (<hdl.handle.net/4263537/5031>).

10) Please send all comments, questions and bug reports to
   hdladmin@cnri.reston.va.us.
